Ques 9: Which method on the session object can be used to remove an object from the cache?

In Hibernate, we use the evict() method of the Session object to remove a specific object
from the first-level cache.
  session.evict(employee);

If we want to remove all objects from the session cache we can use:
  session.evict(object);


Ques 10:  What does @Transactional annotation do?
the @Transactional annotation is used to manage database transactions automatically.
It Follows Acid Properties
When we put @Transactional above a method:
It starts a transaction before the method runs.
If the method runs successfully  it commits the transaction (saves changes permanently).
If any exception/error happens  it rolls back the transaction (undoes changes)
