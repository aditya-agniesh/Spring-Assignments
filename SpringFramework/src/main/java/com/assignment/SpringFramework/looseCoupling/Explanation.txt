Ques 3:
Use @Compenent and @Autowired annotations to in Loosely Coupled code for dependency management

      @Component tells spring boot that this class can contains beans and you have to manage it

      there are other annotations as well:
      @Service: it tells spring that this class contains business logic
      @Controller: it tells spring that this class contains apis
      @Repository: it tells spring that this class have logic to interact with database
      @Configuration+@Beans: when we have to manually define beans we use it.


      @Autowired tells Spring to automatically inject  dependency into a class
       so we don’t have to create the object manually using new.


Ques 4: Demonstrate how you will resolve ambiguity while autowiring bean

        when we have multiple beans and we use autowiring our spring application
        fails because it does not know which one to inject.

        to solve this ambiguity we use annoattion
        @primary  or @Qualifier("name")

            @Component
            @Primary
            public class JioSavan implements MusicPlayer {
                public void display(){
                    System.out.println("JioSavan");
                }
            }



        Note: when we use @primary and @Qualifier together, @Qualifier is preferred
               over @Primary


Ques 5: Perform Constructor Injection in a Spring Bean

            @Autowired
            public Music(MusicPlayer musicPlayer){
                this.musicPlayer = musicPlayer;
            }
